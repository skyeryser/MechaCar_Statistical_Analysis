## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance all provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data. In simpler terms, these variables have an impact on mpg. 
- There is sufficient evidence to reject our null-hypothesis. The slope of the regression is negative because the p-value is 5.35e-11 and the ...
- This linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes fairly effectively even though it has a low p-value of 5.35e-11 which is beneth than the .05 threshold. The R squared value of 0.7149 shows that the regression model describes the dataset 71% of the time, and supports the conclusion that there is a relationship between the dependant and independant variables in the data.
